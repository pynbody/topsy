topsy
=====

This package visualises simulations, and is an add-on to the [pynbody](https://github.com/pynbody/pynbody) analysis package.
Its name nods to the [TIPSY](https://github.com/N-BodyShop/tipsy) project.
It is built using [wgpu](https://wgpu.rs), which is a future-facing GPU standard (with thanks to the [python wgpu bindings](https://wgpu-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide.html)).

At the moment, `topsy` is a bit of a toy project, but it already works quite well with zoom 
(or low resolution) simulations. The future development path will depend on the level
of interest from the community.

Installing
----------

You will need python 3.8 or later, running in a UNIX variant (basically MacOS, Linux or if you're on Windows you need [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)). You can then install `topsy` using `pip` 
as usual:

```
pip install topsy
```

This will install topsy and its dependencies (including `pynbody` itself) into
your current python environment. (If it fails, check that you have python 3.8
or later, and `pip` is itself up-to-date using `pip install -U pip`.)

As usual, you can also install direct from github, e.g.

```
pip install git+https://github.com/pynbody/topsy
```

Or clone the repository and install for development using

```
pip install -e .
```

from inside the cloned repository.

If you want to play with `topsy` without disturbing your current installation,
I recommend using `venv`:

```
# create a toy environment
python -m venv visualiser-env

# activate the new environment
source visualiser-env/bin/activate 

# install
pip install topsy

... other commands ...

# get your old environment back:
deactivate 
```

For more information about venv, see its 
[tutorial page](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).


Trying it out
-------------

*Quick start: if you just want to try it out and you don't have a 
suitable simulation snapshot to hand, you can download some
from the [tangos tutorial datasets (4.8GB)](http://ftp.star.ucl.ac.uk/~app/tangos/tutorial_changa.tar.gz).
You need to untar them (`tar -xzf tutorial_changa.tar.gz` from your command line), then
you can type `topsy pioneer50h128.1536gst1.bwK1.000832` to visualise that file's
dark matter content.*

*Long version:* The package provides one simple command called `topsy`, to be 
called straight from your shell. Pass `topsy` the path to the
simulation that you wish to visualise. 

You can (and probably should) also
tell it what to center on using the `-c` flag, to which valid arguments are:

* `-c none` (just loads the file without changing the centering) 
* `-c halo-1` (uses the shrink sphere center of halo 1; or you can change 1 to any other number)
* `-c zoom` (uses the shrink sphere center on the highest resolution particles, without loading a halo catalogue)
* `-c all` (uses the shrink sphere center on all particles in the file)

By default, it will show you dark matter particles. To change this pass `-p gas` to show gas particles or `-p star` for stars.

If your particles have other quantities defined on them (such as `temp` for gas particles), you can view the density-weighted average quantity by passing `-q temp`. 

By default, topsy uses matplotlib's `twilight_shifted` colormap. To change this pass, for example, `-m viridis`, or the name
of any other [matplotlib colormap](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/colors/colormaps.html#sequential).

Controls in the main window
---------------------------

If everything works, a window will pop up with a beautiful rendering of your simulation. Make sure the window
is in focus (for some reason on MacOS I sometimes have to switch to another application then back to 
python to get this to work). Then you can use the following controls:

* To spin around the centre, drag the mouse. 
* To zoom in and out, use the mouse scroll wheel. 
* To rescale the colours to an appropriate range for the current view, press `r`(ange)
* To return the view to the original orientation and zoom, press `h`(ome)
* To save a snapshot of the current image as a pdf press `s`(ave)

Using from jupyter
------------------

Thanks to [jupyter-rfb](https://jupyter-rfb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), it is possible to use `topsy` within a jupyter notebook. This requires a little more
knowledge than the command line version, but is still fairly straight-forward if
you are familiar with `pynbody`. To open a topsy view within your jupyter notebook, 
try

```python
import pynbody
import topsy 

f = pynbody.load("/path/to/file")
f.physical_units()
h = f.halos()
pynbody.analysis.halo.center(h[1])

vis = topsy.topsy(f.dm)
vis.canvas
```

This loads your data into `f`, performs some centering, creates the `topsy` viewer and then the final line (`vis.canvas`) instructs `jupyter` to bring up the interactive widget. 

Note that you can interact with this widget in exactly the same way as the native window produced by `topsy`. Additionally, you can manipulate things on the fly. For example, you can type `vis.quantity_name = 'temp'` to immediately switch to viewing temperature (compare with the `-q` flag above).
